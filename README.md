# midiToVideo
This messy repo contains my tests for the generation of music videos from midi.
I realized that it's impossible to create an unique script which convert any midi to a video in a decent looking way, 
simply there are too variables depending on the specific midi, so the idea was to create a set of automatic procedures
to help in this process and the put them in a unique library.
However I had no time to do that, maybe in the future I will update this.

What this repo contains are simply some funny experiments I did playing with Python and libraries [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) and [Mido](https://github.com/mido/mido),
and it has no claims to be taken seriously.
